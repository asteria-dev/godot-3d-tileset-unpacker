# Godot 3D Tileset Unpacker
A simple script used to unpack a 3D Tileset individually in Godot

Make sure to enable import Blender in the Project Settings
Make sure to set the path of your Blender in the Editor Settings

First create a new inherited scene, then set the path of the tileset in the script.
